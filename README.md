# HackCompiler
Compiler for the Hack assembly machine language as specified by nand2tetris,
and hopefully with additional opinionated syntactical sugar.

## TODO:
- [ ] Fill out the template Mr. Watson gave you, focusing on the Second (symbolless) pass only.
    - [ ] Make sure it works by comparing results with the nand2tetris assembler. (You can also use Compare.java!)
- [ ] Add the first pass (symbol resolution)
- [ ] If you're motivated, add support for new commands like D=M[139], which decomposes into @139 and D=M.

# VSCode Getting Started guided

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
